My implementation of a telegram bot with a casino concept. At the moment, it has the most primitive functions, such as placing a bet, rating, replenishing the balance (for admins only) and sending a message to the admin. It's not perfect at all, and if I'm not lazy, I'll slowly improve it:) The main task that faced me was to apply all my knowledge in this project, such as aiogram, sqlite and basic python features.

Install the libraries before launching:
```
pip install aiogram==2.23.1
pip install python-dotenv
```
